Demo
=============

This is just a list of things I want to demo, so I don't forget about them when
demo-ing hour comes. 

* Talk about how we used sbt in order to take care of the compiling, dependency
  management, testing and deployment of the project. Reminders: For compiling
  sbt uses a nice directory structure. For testing, we used behavioral testing
  using the __ScalaTest__ library. For deployment we use the assembly plugin
  that packages everything nicely. 

* Talk about how the feature of Scala was used to interface with Java code. 
  we achieved this by calling some unimplemented / not understood? things in 
  scala swing in order to have the full functionality. An example is how we
  overrode the __paint__ method in order to draw the tiles on the main menu. 

* The tiles used in order to portray maps. 

* Used the basic core language functionalies such as classes, and objects. 
  Identified cases where we would need classes as opposed to objects. 

* Use of splat operator, see file: 108:ui.CreateCharacter.scala

* Used the lazy load feature in file 26:tech.TileHelper.scala 

* Used traits in order to describe objects
