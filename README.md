# Sclack

Is a hack and slash game written in Scala. It should go over most of the core
feature of the language, and provide a usable application by the end of this
small case study.

#### Building

To build the project, you'll need Simple Build Tool ([http://www.scala-sbt.org](sbt)).
Go into the main directory, and run `sbt`. The project should build
successfully. 

When you're ready you just need to run the following:

    sbt run

If you want to generate the documentation, then run the following:

    sbt doc
